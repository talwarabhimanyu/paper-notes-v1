I am Abhimanyu and I'm the Founder of [quickfin.ai](https://quickfin.ai). I use this blog to document notes from my readings of research publications (primarily focused on Machine Learning theory and Natural Language Processing). In my notes:
- I try to identify the big picture and connect the dots with related areas of research.
- I try to prove results in papers which are stated without proof.
- I try to dig deeper into the trail of references beginning from a paper.

While I write these notes for my future reference, I hope someone else finds them useful too. I would love to discuss any of these with you in the comments. When in doubt about anything written on this blog, assume that I made a mistake and consult the original paper.
